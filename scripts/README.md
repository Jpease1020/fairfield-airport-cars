# Daily Analysis System

This system provides comprehensive daily analysis of the Fairfield Airport Cars application, generating actionable insights and a running todo list for continuous improvement.

## 🎯 What It Analyzes

### Architecture
- **Components**: Counts and categorizes React components
- **Dependencies**: Checks for outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: Runs ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **File Structure**: Analyzes complexity and organization

### Performance
- **Build Time**: Measures build performance
- **Bundle Size**: Estimates bundle size impact
- **Images**: Identifies unoptimized images
- **Lighthouse**: Performance audits (when configured)

### Security
- **Dependencies**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Environment**: Checks for proper environment configuration
- **Secrets**: Scans for hardcoded secrets
- **Permissions**: Analyzes file permissions

### Business Metrics
- **Pages**: Counts public, admin, and API pages
- **Features**: Identifies implemented business features
- **CMS**: Analyzes content management capabilities
- **Booking System**: Evaluates booking functionality

### Testing
- **Coverage**: Counts test files by type
- **Performance**: Measures test execution time
- **Types**: Identifies unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **Status**: Runs tests and reports results

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup Cron Job
```bash
npm run analyze:setup
```

This will:
- Set up a daily cron job at 8:00 AM
- Make the analysis script executable
- Test the script to ensure it works
- Create necessary directories

### Manual Run
```bash
npm run analyze:run
```

### View Reports
```bash
npm run analyze:reports
```

### View Logs
```bash
npm run analyze:logs
```

## 📊 Output

### JSON Report
Detailed analysis saved to `reports/daily-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Markdown Summary
Quick summary saved to `reports/summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Logs
Execution logs saved to `logs/daily-analysis.log`

## 🎯 Generated Todos

The system automatically generates prioritized todos based on:

- **Critical**: Security issues, broken builds
- **High**: Outdated dependencies, code quality issues
- **Medium**: Performance optimizations, missing features
- **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements

## 📈 Example Output

```
# Daily Analysis Summary - 2024-01-15

## 📊 Quick Stats
- **Components**: 45 total
- **Dependencies**: 25 total, 3 outdated
- **Security Issues**: 0 secrets found
- **Test Coverage**: 12 test files
- **Performance**: 2 large images

## 🎯 Priority Todos
- **[HIGH]** Update 3 outdated dependencies (Security & Performance)
- **[MEDIUM]** Optimize 2 large images (Page Load Speed)
- **[MEDIUM]** Implement analytics tracking for better business insights (Business Intelligence)

## 📈 Recommendations
- Consider implementing Lighthouse CI for automated performance monitoring
- Add more unit tests to improve code coverage
- Implement error tracking for better debugging
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Analysis
Edit `scripts/daily-analysis.js` to:
- Add new analysis categories
- Modify thresholds for todos
- Include additional metrics
- Customize report format

### Cron Schedule
The default schedule is daily at 8:00 AM. To change:
1. Edit `scripts/setup-cron.sh`
2. Modify the `CRON_JOB` variable
3. Re-run `npm run analyze:setup`

### Environment Variables
The script respects these environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV`: Affects build analysis
- `CI`: Skips interactive prompts in CI environments

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script fails to run**
```bash
# Check permissions
chmod +x scripts/daily-analysis.js

# Check Node.js version
node --version
```

**Cron job not running**
```bash
# Check cron service
sudo service cron status

# View cron logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/cron
```

**Build analysis fails**
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Check for build errors
npm run build
```

### Debug Mode
Run with verbose logging:
```bash
DEBUG=* node scripts/daily-analysis.js
```

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

The analysis system itself can be improved by:

1. **Adding new metrics** based on business needs
2. **Refining thresholds** based on team feedback
3. **Integrating with CI/CD** for automated reporting
4. **Adding Slack/email notifications** for critical issues
5. **Creating dashboards** for trend analysis
