# ðŸ§ª Strategic Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Fairfield Airport Cars application, focusing on reliability, maintainability, and user experience. The plan leverages RTL (React Testing Library) integration tests, targeted unit tests, and UI/visual regression tests.

---

## 1. **Testing Philosophy**
- **Integration-first:** Most tests should simulate real user flows and interactions across components/pages.
- **Unit tests:** Used for critical business logic, utility functions, and isolated component logic.
- **UI/Visual regression:** Automated tools to catch visual/UI regressions and accessibility issues.

---

## 2. **Test Types & Coverage Goals**

### A. RTL Integration Tests
- **Pages:** Home, Book, About, Help, Success, Cancel, Portal, Privacy, Terms
- **Flows:** Booking, Navigation, Error handling, Form validation, Accessibility
- **Components:** Header, Footer, Navigation, BookingForm, Modal, Alerts
- **Goal:** 80%+ of user-facing flows covered

### B. Unit Tests
- **Business logic:** Fare calculation, validation, API handlers
- **Utilities:** Date/time, formatting, helpers
- **Goal:** 90%+ of core logic covered

### C. UI/Visual Regression
- **Storybook stories for all major components/pages**
- **Chromatic or Percy integration for PR checks**
- **Goal:** No unreviewed visual diffs merged

---

## 3. **Test Organization**
- `tests/unit/` â€” Unit tests for logic, utilities, and isolated components
- `tests/integration/` â€” Integration tests for user flows and multi-component interactions
- `tests/e2e/` â€” End-to-end and page integrity tests
- `storybook/` â€” Visual regression stories

---

## 4. **Best Practices**
- Mock external APIs/services
- Use data-testid for critical elements
- Test accessibility (a11y) with axe-core or similar
- Keep tests fast and deterministic
- Review and update tests with every major feature or refactor

---

## 5. **Continuous Improvement**
- Review test coverage monthly
- Add tests for every bug fix/regression
- Encourage PRs to include/modify tests as needed

---

## 6. **Ownership**
- All team members contribute to and maintain tests
- Testing is part of the definition of done for every feature

---

## 7. **Next Steps**
- [ ] Expand RTL integration tests for all major pages/components
- [ ] Add/verify unit tests for business logic and utilities
- [ ] Scaffold Storybook and integrate Chromatic for visual regression
- [ ] Integrate all tests into CI pipeline
