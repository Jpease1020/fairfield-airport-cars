## 🎯 **For Developers**

### **Start Here (Priority Order)**
1. **[MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](./architecture/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - **DEFINITIVE GUIDE** - Understand the architecture philosophy
2. **[DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](./DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)** - Quick reference and implementation guidance
3. **[FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md](./features/FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md)** - What features we're rebuilding
4. **[NEXTJS_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md](./implementation/NEXTJS_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)** - Best practices for implementation

### **Architecture Philosophy**
- **Simplicity First**: No over-engineering for features we don't need
- **Single Owner Focus**: Gregg is driver + owner = streamlined workflows
- **Performance Excellence**: Fast, reliable, mobile-first
- **Maintainability**: Clean code that's easy to understand and modify
- **No Duplication**: Every feature serves a clear purpose

### **Core Business Features**
1. **Simple Booking System** - Easy for customers
2. **Live Tracking** - Real-time updates for customers
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Simple interface for Gregg
4. **Payment System** - Square integration for revenue

### **What We're NOT Building**
- ❌ Multi-driver management (Gregg is the only driver)
- ❌ Complex analytics (simple metrics only)
- ❌ Advanced role permissions (admin vs customer only)
- ❌ Over-engineered features

## 🔧 **Development Workflow**

### **Before Adding Any Feature**
1. **Ask: "Does Gregg need this?"**
2. **Check: "Is this duplicating existing functionality?"**
3. **Verify: "Is this mobile-optimized?"**
4. **Test: "Does this improve customer experience?"**

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] **Simple**: Easy to understand and maintain
- [ ] **Mobile-First**: Works perfectly on mobile
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant bundle impact
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] **No Duplication**: Doesn't repeat existing code
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript implementation

### **Success Metrics**
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds
- **Mobile Performance**: 90+ Lighthouse
- **Bundle Size**: < 300KB
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 100%
- **Test Coverage**: > 80%
