# 🤖 AI Usage Guardrails & Approval Workflow

## 🎯 Core Principles

### **Approval-First Workflow**
- **No file writes or code edits will be made without explicit user approval**
- All non-trivial changes require user review and approval
- AI will present summaries, risks, and alternatives before any action

### **Critical File Protection**
- **Never write directly** to critical configuration files without explicit approval
- **Always ask first** for architectural changes, design system modifications, or new dependencies

### **Transparency & Communication**
- **Always explain "why" before "how"**
- Present risks, trade-offs, and alternatives
- Provide clear summaries of proposed changes

---

## 📁 **Protected File Categories**

### **🔒 High Protection (Manual Review Required)**
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
- `src/lib/design-system/tokens.ts` - Design system tokens
- `src/styles/standard-layout.css` - Core CSS variables
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.env*` files - Environment configuration

### **⚠️ Medium Protection (Approval Recommended)**
- `src/components/ui/layout/` - Core layout components
- `src/components/ui/` - Design system components
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `src/lib/design-system/` - Design system utilities

### **✅ Standard Protection (Normal Workflow)**
- Page components (`src/app/*/page.tsx`)
- Feature components (`src/components/features/`)
- Utility functions (`src/lib/utils/`)

---

## 🚦 **Approval Workflow**

### **Step 1: Change Proposal**
AI will present:
- **What**: Clear description of the proposed change
- **Why**: Business/technical rationale
- **Files**: List of files to be modified
- **Risks**: Potential issues or side effects
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered

### **Step 2: User Review**
User can:
- **Approve**: "OK" or "Apply" to proceed
- **Modify**: Request changes to the proposal
- **Reject**: "No" or "Cancel" to abort
- **Request More Info**: Ask for clarification or alternatives

### **Step 3: Implementation**
- AI applies approved changes
- Provides summary of what was changed
- Offers rollback option if needed

## 🛠️ **Communication Protocols**

### **For Critical Changes**
```
🔒 CRITICAL CHANGE PROPOSAL
📁 Files: .eslintrc.js, src/lib/design-system/tokens.ts
🎯 Goal: Add new ESLint rules to prevent hardcoded colors
⚠️ Risks: May break existing code if rules are too strict
✅ Benefits: Enforces design system consistency
❓ Approval Required: YES
```

### **For Standard Changes**
```
📝 CHANGE PROPOSAL
📁 Files: src/app/page.tsx
🎯 Goal: Fix button text color inheritance
⚠️ Risks: Minimal - only affects button styling
✅ Benefits: Proper contrast and accessibility
❓ Approval Required: RECOMMENDED
```

---

## 🔄 **Undo & Rollback Process**

### **Immediate Undo**
- User can request "undo" for any AI-applied change
- AI will provide the exact commands to revert
- Changes are tracked for easy rollback

### **Batch Rollback**
- For multiple changes, AI will provide a summary of what to revert
- Step-by-step rollback instructions available

---

## 📋 **Best Practices**

### **For Users**
- **Always review** critical file changes
- **Ask questions** if the rationale isn't clear
- **Request alternatives** if you don't like the approach
- **Test changes** in development before approving

### **For AI**
- **Always explain the "why"** before the "how"
- **Present risks and alternatives** for every change
- **Ask for clarification** if requirements are unclear
- **Provide rollback options** for every change

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Quality Metrics**
- Zero unauthorized changes to critical files
- All changes properly documented and explained
- User satisfaction with change proposals
- Reduced need for rollbacks

### **Efficiency Metrics**
- Clear, actionable change proposals
- Quick approval process for standard changes
- Minimal back-and-forth for clarification

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Status**

### **Current Status**
- ✅ Approval-first workflow implemented
- ✅ Critical file protection active
- ✅ Communication protocols established
- 🔄 Enhanced ESLint rules (pending approval)
- 🔄 Automated testing integration (pending)

### **Next Steps**
1. Review and approve enhanced ESLint rules
2. Implement automated testing for critical paths
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Create onboarding documentation for new team members
