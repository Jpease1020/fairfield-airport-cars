# ðŸš€ Fairfield Airport Cars - Development Roadmap

## ðŸ“Š Current snapshot

- Shipped (MVP core): booking, Square payments with balance management, admin dashboard, baseline notifications, design system, auth
- In progress: real-time tracking/availability, analytics/monitoring visibility
- Principles: keep it simple, mobile-first, no duplication, all public copy is CMS-editable

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next 4 weeks (MVP hardening)

1) Payments to production-ready
- Live-keys configuration, refund/cancellation consistency, receipts/invoices
- Decline/timeout retries, clear failure states, idempotency on server routes

2) Booking flow hardening + tests
- Expand critical-path e2e tests (quote â†’ book â†’ pay â†’ confirm â†’ cancel/refund)
- Robust empty/error/loading states and recovery paths

3) Real-time availability and status
- Promote driver availability and booking status to live with fallback (SSE/poll)
- Customer status page polish: ETA confidence, arrived/complete transitions

4) Notifications (SMS/Email)
- Confirmation, driver assigned, arriving soon, payment receipt
- Queue + retry + observability; admin resend from dashboard

5) Mobile-first UX and accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA, 44px targets, skeletons/progressive loading, performance budget on critical pages

6) Admin ops essentials
- Simple scheduling view and basic earnings; today/queue health on dashboard

7) Analytics and monitoring
- Funnel metrics, error tracking, performance dashboards; set success thresholds

8) Security and platform guardrails
- Rate limiting, input validation, Firestore rules review, secret hygiene, feature flags

9) Content/CMS coverage
- Ensure all user-facing copy is CMS-managed and mapped consistently
