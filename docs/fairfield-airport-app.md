🚗 Fairfield Airport Car Service – App Overview

🛠 What we’re building

This is a mobile-first web app for a premium private driving service based in Fairfield County, CT. It replaces Uber/Lyft for airport runs so the driver (Gregg) can keep more of his earnings while providing customers with a dependable, luxury experience.

The app’s goal is to let customers:
✅ Quickly book rides
✅ Pay online (Stripe)
✅ Receive text/email confirmations
✅ Trust Gregg as their go-to driver

This is a lean MVP, not a large-scale platform. There’s only one driver (Gregg) for now.

⚡ Optional next level: If you want me + Gemini to collaborate directly (via Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol):
	•	I can help you spin up a lightweight MCP server so I keep memory/context and Gemini can focus on code generation.
	•	You’d basically act as the “orchestrator” asking questions or sending prompts between me and Gemini.
