# 🧪 Testing Strategy Summary - Fairfield Airport Cars

## **🎯 Overall Testing Strategy**

### **Safety-First Approach**
✅ **All external APIs are mocked** to prevent:
- ❌ Real payments being processed
- ❌ Real SMS being sent  
- ❌ Real emails being sent
- ❌ Real Google Maps API calls
- ❌ Real Firebase writes to production

### **Three-Layer Testing Architecture**

1. **UI Tests (Playwright)** - Complete user journeys with mocked APIs
2. **API Tests (Jest/Supertest)** - Backend endpoints with mocked services  
3. **Unit Tests (Jest)** - Individual functions with mocked dependencies

## **🛡️ Safety Protocols Implemented**

### **Mocked External Services**

| Service | Mock Strategy | Safety Benefit |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Square Payments** | Mock checkout URLs and responses | No real payments processed |
| **Twilio SMS** | Mock SMS sending with test message IDs | No real SMS sent |
| **Nodemailer** | Mock email sending with test message IDs | No real emails sent |
| **Google Maps** | Mock distance calculations and autocomplete | No API quota usage |
| **Firebase** | Mock database operations | No production data writes |
| **OpenAI** | Mock AI responses with fallback logic | No API quota usage |

### **Test Environment Configuration**
```typescript
// All external APIs mocked
