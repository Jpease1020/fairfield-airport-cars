# 🎯 Cursor Expert Evaluation Rules

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: NO FILE DELETION WITHOUT PERMISSION

**NEVER DELETE FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
- Always ask "Should I delete [filename]?" before deleting any file
- Get approval for each file individually  
- No bulk deletions without explicit permission
- This applies to all file operations (delete, move, rename)
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - always ask first

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: PREVENT CODE DUPLICATION

**NEVER CREATE NEW CODE WITHOUT CHECKING FOR EXISTING SIMILAR CODE**

**BEFORE creating ANY new code, you MUST:**

1. **Search the entire codebase** for similar functionality:
   - Use `codebase_search` for semantic matches
   - Use `grep_search` for exact function/component names
   - Use `file_search` for similar file names

2. **Check these locations FIRST:**
   - `src/design/components/` - Reusable UI components
   - `src/lib/services/` - Business logic services
   - `src/app/` - Page components
   - `src/types/` - TypeScript definitions
   - `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks

3. **If similar code exists:**
   - **REUSE** existing code instead of creating new
   - **EXTEND** existing functionality if needed
   - **REFACTOR** existing code to be more generic
   - **NEVER** create duplicates

4. **Examples of what to check:**
   - Driver profile components (we had duplicates!)
   - Service functions (booking, auth, etc.)
   - UI components (buttons, forms, cards)
   - Type definitions
   - Utility functions

5. **If you find similar code:**
   - Ask user: "Should I reuse the existing [component/service] or create a new one?"
   - Explain the differences and trade-offs
   - Get explicit permission before creating new code

**DUPLICATION PREVENTION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Searched codebase for similar functionality
- [ ] Checked design system components
- [ ] Checked service layer
- [ ] Checked type definitions
- [ ] Asked user for permission to create new code
- [ ] Documented why new code is needed

## 🚫 ANTI-DUPLICATION ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)

### **MANDATORY BEFORE ANY NEW CODE:**
1. **SEARCH FIRST** - Search codebase for existing patterns before writing ANY new code
2. **REUSE EXISTING** - Modify existing code instead of creating duplicates
3. **PATTERN CHECK** - Look for similar components, services, layouts, providers
4. **DOCUMENT NECESSITY** - Explain why new code is needed if existing code can't be used

### **FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE STOP):**
- ❌ Create duplicate layouts when layout system exists
- ❌ Create duplicate providers when provider system exists  
- ❌ Create duplicate services when service layer exists
- ❌ Create duplicate components when design system exists
- ❌ Create duplicate authentication when auth system exists
- ❌ Create duplicate routing when routing system exists

### **REQUIRED SEARCH PATTERNS BEFORE NEW CODE:**
```bash
# MANDATORY SEARCHES:
grep_search "layout" - Find existing layout patterns
grep_search "provider" - Find existing provider patterns  
grep_search "service" - Find existing service patterns
grep_search "component" - Find existing component patterns
file_search "Layout" - Find layout files
file_search "Provider" - Find provider files
file_search "Service" - Find service files
codebase_search "authentication" - Find auth patterns
codebase_search "routing" - Find routing patterns
```

### **VIOLATION RESPONSE:**
- **IMMEDIATE STOP** - If duplicate code is detected, stop immediately
- **REVERT CHANGES** - Remove duplicate code and use existing
- **DOCUMENT LESSON** - Add to architecture docs why duplication occurred
- **UPDATE RULES** - Strengthen enforcement if needed

### **CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST (ENFORCED):**
- [ ] **Searched existing codebase** for similar functionality
- [ ] **Checked if existing code can be modified** instead of duplicated
- [ ] **Verified no similar patterns exist** in the codebase
- [ ] **Asked: "Can I reuse existing code?"** before writing new code
- [ ] **Documented why new code is necessary** if existing code can't be used

## 🚫 FILE DELETION PROTECTION (CRITICAL)

### **NEVER DELETE FILES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION:**
- ❌ **NEVER** delete files without asking "Should I delete [filename]?"
- ❌ **NEVER** use `rm` or `delete_file` without explicit user approval
- ❌ **NEVER** assume files are safe to delete
- ❌ **NEVER** delete files in bulk without individual approval

### **REQUIRED BEFORE ANY FILE DELETION:**
1. **ASK EXPLICITLY**: "Should I delete [filename]?"
2. **EXPLAIN WHY**: Explain why the file should be deleted
3. **GET APPROVAL**: Wait for explicit user approval
4. **CONFIRM ACTION**: Confirm the deletion before proceeding
5. **DOCUMENT**: Note what was deleted and why

### **SAFE FILE OPERATIONS:**
- ✅ **MOVE FILES**: Use `mv` to reorganize instead of delete
- ✅ **RENAME FILES**: Use `mv` to rename instead of delete
- ✅ **ARCHIVE FILES**: Move to backup location instead of delete
- ✅ **COMMENT OUT**: Comment out code instead of deleting files

### **EXCEPTIONS (EMERGENCY ONLY):**
- **Critical security issues** - Files with exposed secrets
- **Build-breaking files** - Files causing immediate build failures
- **Explicit user request** - User specifically asks for deletion
- **Temporary files** - Clearly marked as temporary/test files

## Automated Daily Senior Developer Review
- **Every 24 hours, run a comprehensive codebase review as if by a senior developer.**
- The review must:
  - Check for code cleanliness, readability, and maintainability
  - Evaluate architecture and structure for scalability and best practices
  - Ensure high test coverage and quality (unit, integration, accessibility, performance)
  - Identify technical debt, code smells, and anti-patterns
  - Confirm consistent code style and documentation
  - Provide actionable feedback and improvement suggestions
  - Highlight any regressions or risks from recent changes
  - **CHECK FOR DUPLICATION** - Identify any duplicate code patterns
- This review is **proactive** and must run automatically—never wait for a manual request.
- Summarize findings and recommendations clearly for the team.

## Development Server Management Rules
- **ALWAYS check if the development server is already running before starting it**
- **Use these commands to check and manage the dev server:**
  ```bash
  # Check if dev server is running on port 3000
  lsof -ti:3000
  
  # Kill any existing process on port 3000
  kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000) 2>/dev/null || true
  
  # Start dev server only if not already running
  if ! lsof -ti:3000 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    npm run dev
  else
    echo "Dev server already running on port 3000"
  fi
  ```
- **Never start multiple dev servers simultaneously**
- **Always use port 3000 for consistency**
- **If you see build errors, restart the dev server cleanly**

## Overview
