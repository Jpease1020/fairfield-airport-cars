# üéØ Cursor Expert Evaluation Rules

## Automated Daily Senior Developer Review
- **Every 24 hours, run a comprehensive codebase review as if by a senior developer.**
- The review must:
  - Check for code cleanliness, readability, and maintainability
  - Evaluate architecture and structure for scalability and best practices
  - Ensure high test coverage and quality (unit, integration, accessibility, performance)
  - Identify technical debt, code smells, and anti-patterns
  - Confirm consistent code style and documentation
  - Provide actionable feedback and improvement suggestions
  - Highlight any regressions or risks from recent changes
- This review is **proactive** and must run automatically‚Äînever wait for a manual request.
- Summarize findings and recommendations clearly for the team.

## Development Server Management Rules
- **ALWAYS check if the development server is already running before starting it**
- **Use these commands to check and manage the dev server:**
  ```bash
  # Check if dev server is running on port 3000
  lsof -ti:3000
  
  # Kill any existing process on port 3000
  kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000) 2>/dev/null || true
  
  # Start dev server only if not already running
  if ! lsof -ti:3000 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    npm run dev
  else
    echo "Dev server already running on port 3000"
  fi
  ```
- **Never start multiple dev servers simultaneously**
- **Always use port 3000 for consistency**
- **If you see build errors, restart the dev server cleanly**

## Overview
